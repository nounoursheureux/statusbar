This is a little status bar I made for my own purpose. It uses dzen2, a very nice and flexible tool for making status bar. 
Here is a video of it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5FIPhRlieA 
I did this for myself, so I really didn't care about code flexibility. But know I feel ashamed of that, so I will try to improve my code. 
I did not create the icons, these are sm4tik's ones.

# Dependencies

Here is the (huge) list of dependencies:   
- dzen2
- gdbar (should be included with dzen2)
- df
- acpi
- date
- mpd & mpc
- for the update checker I redirect the output of `updatechecker` in a file
- for the mail checker I created a script that creates a file with the number of new mails
